===0.32 (unreleased)===
  * Changed SSL detection to use a HEAD request rather than GET (should reduce bandwidth use, noticeably quicker detection in practice).  If HEAD fails with response code 405 (Amazon.de and a few other sites do this, it falls back to a GET request.)

  * Implementing whitelist ([http://i.imgur.com/Xxtfy.png Preview])

  * Strings (displayed) moved into DTD and Properties file so any future localization should be quick and easy.

===0.31===
  * Fixes  Issue 4 : Top level/subdomain compatibility for auto-generated rules. HTTPS Everywhere rule creation should now work for all top level domains. Tested with two, three, and four letter TLDs as well as complex cases such as co.uk, com.au, etc. 
  * Improved recognition of bad SSL certificates. 

===0.30===
  * Added 3 preferences:
  * Enable/disable (without restarting FF)
  * Do not prompt for rule generation (only alert when HTTPS is available)
  * Auto-forward to HTTPS when available ("Silent mode") 

===0.25===
  * Initial release
