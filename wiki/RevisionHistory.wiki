  * Adds domain whitelisting abilities.  You can whitelist specific domains (www.google.com, code.google.com) or use a wildcard and whitelist {{{*}}}.google.com, etc.

  * Auto-forward is now separate from the rule creation prompt preference (without both options checked, it will auto-forward and still prompt you to save a rule)

  * Numerous bug fixes and code improvements

  * Screenshot available here: http://i.imgur.com/cZESl.png

  * Improved recognition of bad SSL certificates.
